# 32_xiaomiSmarthome.pm
This module is a plugin for [http://fhem.de].
The idea is described [in the FHEM board (German)](https://forum.fhem.de/index.php/topic,63212.0.html).
As a start I forked the [32_Yeelight.pm repository](https://github.com/thaliondrambor/32_YeeLight.pm).

The Xiaomi Smart Home Gateway API is described within [this repository](https://github.com/foscoj/lumi-gateway-local-api), forked it in preparation for translation.

My testing reference is currently [this Python script](https://github.com/jon1012/mihome) from [this blog post](https://notes.jmsinfor.com/blog/post/admin/Xiaomi-Hub), which inspired me to buy these devices in the first place.
